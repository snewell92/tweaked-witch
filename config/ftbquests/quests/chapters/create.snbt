Make sure you aren’t typing in a text field first, though!"

You can &6right click on most Create blocks&r to rotate them or alter them in some way. &dWhich side of the block you click on&r determines which way the object rotates. Additionally, you can &6shift right click&r most Create items (and some vanilla, such as levers or hoppers) &ato instantly remove them directly into your inventory&r. An incredibly useful feature!"
