				"&eKākāpō&r, often called owl parrots, are nocturnal flightless parrots endemic to &cNew Zealand&r. These chubsters are some of the longest living birds on the planet- capable of living up to 100 years! Though they were &dnearly wiped out&r by the introduction of mammals to the island, there are many &aconservation efforts&r on nearby islands and they have recently been &asuccessfully reintroduced&r to the &cSanctuary Mountain Maungatautari&r on the mainland. "
				""
				"There are currently only &d247 living Kākāpō in existence&r. As such, they have been made &aincredibly scarce&r in the modpack here as well- being found only in the &cGuiana Shield&r biome. To increase your chances of finding this bird, &6try using the&r &bSummoning Ritual&r &6from&r &lArs Nouveau&r in a &cGuiana Shield&r."
